# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS

Turning Raw Data into Meaningful Insights

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository : a collection of hands-on projects where I explore real-world datasets to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, validate assumptions, and extract actionable insights using Python.

This repository demonstrates not just what I analyze, but how and why analytical decisions are made, from data cleaning to visualization and interpretation.

### What You’ll Find in This Repository

Each notebook in this repository follows a structured EDA workflow:

#### Data Understanding
Inspecting data structure, types, and basic statistics

#### Data Quality Assessment
Identifying missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

#### Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features, and managing outliers using statistically sound methods (IQR, median imputation)

#### Univariate Analysis
Exploring distributions, skewness, and anomalies in individual variables

#### Bivariate Analysis
Examining relationships between variables using correlation analysis, scatter plots, box plots, and regression plots

#### Multivariate Analysis
Understanding interaction effects across multiple variables and categories

#### Insight Generation & Recommendations
Translating analytical findings into clear, data-driven conclusions

# Some of the Project Include:

1.World Population Data EDA

Focus: Global population trends across continents and time
Key Techniques:

Temporal trend analysis

Continent-level aggregation

Correlation analysis

Heatmaps and line plots

Key Insights:

Uneven population growth across continents

Strong regional differences in population concentration

Long-term growth patterns reveal shifting global demographics

2.Student Performance Data EDA

Focus: Factors influencing student academic performance
Key Techniques:

Missing value visualization and treatment

Outlier detection using IQR

Numerical, categorical, and multivariate analysis

Correlation and regression analysis

Key Insights:

Absences negatively impact GPA

Study time positively influences performance (with diminishing returns)

Parental support and tutoring are strong performance amplifiers

#### Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Missingno – missing value analysis

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

### Why This Repository Matters

This repository is designed to show that EDA is not just plotting charts, but a critical thinking process that:

Improves data quality

Prevents misleading conclusions

Guides feature selection for modeling

Drives better decision-making

Every project emphasizes clarity, reasoning, and interpretability — skills essential for data analysts and data scientists.

### How to Use This Repository
